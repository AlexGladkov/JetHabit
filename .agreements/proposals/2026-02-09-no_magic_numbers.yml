proposal_type: add
change:
    description: Add rule to forbid magic numbers and hardcoded constants in business logic
    details: |-
        Detect numeric literals (excluding 0, 1, -1) and hardcoded string constants
        used directly in business logic Kotlin files. Constants should be extracted
        to companion objects or top-level const val declarations.
reason: Magic numbers reduce code readability and make maintenance harder
impact: All Kotlin files in shared/ and composeApp/ will be checked for magic numbers
